## Upload s3 report file

verified minio 

create file in ~/.config/report_send_s3

example:
```
endpoint_url = s3.ru-1.storage.selcloud.ru
access_key_id = login
secret_access_key = password
use_ssl =  true
bucket_name = name_bucket
```

if file ~/.config/report_send_s3  is in the system, then the program will try to download the report to s3 

By default, file rotation occurs when the value is above 30 files.


You can specify the quantity
```sh
sudo local_trableshoot --count-rotate-s3=20
```
